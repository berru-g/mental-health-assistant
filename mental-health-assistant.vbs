'Hello, this is "M.H.A-V1.0.1", a simple mental health assistant.
'Created for anyone in reconstruction, following a burnout or other hard blow in life.
'Based on the principle that our doubts are over but that we can fall very low in our self-esteem during this short period,
'it is necessary to set up tools and new habits must be put in place quickly before locking oneself into a vegetative state.
'This is not the ideal tool but a trial under development.
'If you want to participate in its evolution, I invite you to create a commit, or share your ideas and advice with me in the comments. For to build a relevant tool together. Thanks
'To use the wizard please download it, then simply open it with a double click, the vbs format is supported by all windows computers. 
'Currently working on a version developed with python and tkinter- by berru 22 "M.H.A-V1.0.1"
